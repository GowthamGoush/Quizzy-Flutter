A few resources that helped to start my first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
